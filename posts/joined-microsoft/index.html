<p>Hello, folks! Delighted to announce that I recently joined the Cloud Developer Advocacy team at Microsoft 😃 😃</p>
<p>I was fortunate to have worked on developer platforms (PaaS and Serverless) during my stint as a Product Manager at Oracle with a focus on developer experience and advocacy — so I decided to convert this into a full-time role and glad to have joined a company which lays a huge emphasis on developer outreach.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*YfUaB9cUqa6o1DmAlfVk4A.jpeg" alt="https://makeameme.org/meme/i-should-be-5b5bb0"><em><a href="https://makeameme.org/meme/i-should-be-5b5bb0">https://makeameme.org/meme/i-should-be-5b5bb0</a></em></p>
<p>I am humbled and a little intimidated at the same time, to have joined this amazing team at Microsoft. You will realize that this feeling of being “<em>a little intimidated</em>” is not without reason, once you take a look at the list below! There are some rock stars in there, but you know what — sometimes being the “dumbest person in the room” can be good for you 😉
<a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/advocates/index.html"><strong>Microsoft Cloud Advocates</strong>
*Our team&rsquo;s charter is to help every technologist on the planet succeed, be they students or those working in…*developer.microsoft.com</a></p>
<h3 id="what-will-i-be-doing-and-what-have-i-been-up-to-so-far">What will I be doing and what have I been up to so far?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>TL;DR: a whole bunch of things, with a focus on developers and technical communities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This includes (but not limited to) producing content in the form of code, blogs, demos, tutorials; run workshops and hackathon; engaging with you in-person at events, conferences, meetups, and (hopefully) much more. Also, I’ll be on the lookout for your feedback/inputs/pain-points and funnel them back to respective teams at Microsoft, such as engineering, PM, etc. (yes, this time I’ll be on the other side 😉). And, in case you were curious, some of the specific areas I’ll be focusing on include <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/">Azure</a>, Kubernetes, Serverless, Go and Kafka — yeah I know, all the 🔥 🔥 stuff!</p>
<p>It’s been a couple of weeks since I joined and things seem to be moving at a rapid pace. I have been busy with onboarding (obviously!), getting to know Microsoft (yeah it’s huge!), chatting with colleagues, teams and getting up to speed with things in general. In between all this, I already have a few talks lined up, got to be part of an interesting little project and kick-started a new blog series — stay tuned!</p>
<h3 id="interested-in-joining-the-team"><strong>Interested in joining the team?</strong></h3>
<p>Maybe you’re already working in Developer Relations, new to Developer Advocacy or just curious about it — doesn’t matter, let’s talk 🙌 Please DM me on <a href="https://twitter.com/abhi_tweeter">Twitter</a> or ping me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhirockzz/">LinkedIn</a></p>
<h3 id="the--is-a-small-place">“the ☁️ is a small place”</h3>
<p>Hope to see you at conferences, meetups or even <a href="http://hub.com/abhirockzz">GitHub</a>!</p>
<p>Cheers! 😄</p>
