      <description>Hello, folks! Delighted to announce that I recently joined the Cloud Developer Advocacy team at Microsoft 😃 😃
I was fortunate to have worked on developer platforms (PaaS and Serverless) during my stint as a Product Manager at Oracle with a focus on developer experience and advocacy — so I decided to convert this into a full-time role and glad to have joined a company which lays a huge emphasis on developer outreach.</description>
